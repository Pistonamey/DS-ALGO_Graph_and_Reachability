# DS-ALGO_Graph_and_Reachability

1. C program that uses the “pebble game” technique to test if an input graph is minimally rigid (in two dimensions).
The first line of the input will be n, the number of vertices. n will not exceed 100. Each of the remaining 2n – 3 lines will
contain two values in the range 0 . . . n – 1 to designate an undirected edge. (Self-loops and parallel edges will not be
included.) Each input line should be echoed to the output before being processed. The last line of your output should be
either 1) an indication that the graph is minimally rigid (“Laman”) or 2) an indication that the last edge processed is
“redundant” along with the set of vertices giving the rigid subgraph for the redundant edge.

2. If a pebble is moved, you should output the vertices on the pebble’s path.
